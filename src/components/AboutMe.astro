      My name is Francisco but they call me Paco. I started programming at the
      age of 16 and from there I decided to study Software Engineering.
      I highly value having an <strong>open-minded approach</strong>, an insatiable hunger for <strong>learning</strong>, 
      and the <strong>cultivation of robust team dynamics</strong>.

      Some of my successes include <strong
        >managing the development of a Shopify application at my previous
        company</strong
      >

      Regarding my current situation, <strong
        >I am involved in a business project working as a Frontend developer at <em
